when analyzing the source code of the program, we see that it grant a shell if the auth function return 0
to do that, we need to provide a login that is superior to 5 printable characters, and his corresponding serial
to check if the serial is valid, the auth function take the 4th character in the login string
it is XORed with 0x1337 (4919 in decimal) and added to 6221293, this give us the base number
then, for each character, there is a XOR operation with the decimal value of the character, then taken modulo 0x539 (1337 in decimal)
so, for the login "abcdef", the serial is 6232802, when we enter those informations we get a setuid shell
