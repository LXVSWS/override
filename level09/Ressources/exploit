PIE enabled makes the program's code section load at a random address each run, similar to ASLR
so the address of the secret_backdoor function change every execution, so we cannot predict it directly
instead, we have to find the relative offset the function compared to the base address of the executable

disas secret_backdoor (in gdb)
0x000000000000088c <+0>:     push   %rbp
0000088c is the relative offset
