in the decompiled code, we see that the result of 322424845 minus our input is sent to a decrypt function as a key
in the decrypt function, the program transforms the string Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3 by XORing each character with this key
after the XOR operation, it checks if the result matches Congratulations!, if it does, we get a shell
so we need to find the key that transforms the string Q}|usfg~sf{}|a3 into Congratulations! by XORing
we convert each character of both strings to their ASCII value, then to binary, then perform the XOR operation for each bit
we convert the binary value we get to his decimal value, and we do that for every character, and we get 18 every time
so the key is 18, to send it to the decrypt function we have to put 322424827 as our input
