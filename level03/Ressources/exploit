in the decompiled code, we see that the result of 322424845 minus our input is sent to a decrypt function as a key
in the decrypt function, the program transforms the string Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3 by XORing each character with this key
after the XOR operation, it checks if the result matches Congratulations!, if it does, we get a shell

so we need to find the key that transforms the string Q}|usfg~sf{}|a3 into Congratulations! by XORing
when performing the XOR operation for each character of both strings, we get 18 every time
so the key is 18, to send it to the decrypt function we have to put 322424827 as our input
