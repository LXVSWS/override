this is a program that allow us to read and write on stack memory
when reading the source code we saw that we cannot input an index that is a multiple of 3 or whose division by 16777216 gives 183
we also cannot use environment variables to help us so we will use a ret2libc exploit into the store_number function
we know that the buffer allow 400 bytes but when we put indexes above this limit we found some interesting data, in particular at index 114
we found 4158936339, converted in hexadecimal it's F7E45513, that look like an address, we will assume that is EIP and do some tests
